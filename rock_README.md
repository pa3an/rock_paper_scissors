# rock_paper_scissors
# A simple project for a beginner Python programmer
# The program allows you to play the classic 'rock, paper, scissors'
# game against the computer, usint the random function and a simple 
# if-else loop
# The built in 'while' function allows to keep score, stored in a 
# simple list
# While this is a relatively simple piece of code, it would have taken 
# my a whole day to write it.
# With the help of ChatGPT, however, it only took me a few minutes
